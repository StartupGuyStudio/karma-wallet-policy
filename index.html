<h2>3. Subscription & Access Model</h2>
<p>
Karma Wallet offers time-based access in the form of challenge extensions ("days access"). When a user purchases access, the selected number of days is added to their existing journey.
</p>
<p>
Purchasing additional days does not reset progress or remove stored data. It only extends access to app features, including tracking, reports, and AI-generated insights.
</p>
<p>
Payment transactions are processed by authorized app marketplace providers (such as Apple App Store or Google Play). We do not directly collect or store payment card details.
</p>
